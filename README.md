## About

Monero/Aeon offline wallet generator forked from https://github.com/moneromooo-monero/monero-wallet-generator.

This page generates a new Monero or Aeon address. It is self contained and does all the necessary calculations locally, so is suitable for generating a new wallet on a machine that is not connected to the network, and may even never be. This way, you can create a Monero or Aeon wallet without risking the keys.
